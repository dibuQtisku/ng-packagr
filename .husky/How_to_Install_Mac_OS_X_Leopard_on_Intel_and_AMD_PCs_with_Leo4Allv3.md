Mac OS X Leopard is one of the most popular versions of Apple's operating system, but it is not officially supported on non-Apple hardware. However, thanks to the efforts of some talented hackers, there are ways to install Mac OS X Leopard on Intel and AMD PCs using a custom DVD called Leo4Allv3. In this article, we will show you how to do it step by step.

## What You Need
 
- A PC with an Intel or AMD processor that supports SSE2 and SSE3 instructions.
- A DVD burner and a blank DVD.
- A USB flash drive or an external hard drive.
- The Leo4Allv3 ISO file, which you can download from [here](https://archive.org/details/OsxLeopardInstall).
- A backup of your important data, as this process will erase your hard drive.

## Step 1: Burn the Leo4Allv3 ISO to a DVD
 
Using your favorite DVD burning software, burn the Leo4Allv3 ISO file to a blank DVD. Make sure you use the lowest possible speed and verify the disc after burning. You can also use a USB flash drive or an external hard drive instead of a DVD, but you will need to use a tool like [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to write the ISO file to it.
 
## Step 2: Boot from the Leo4Allv3 DVD
 
Insert the Leo4Allv3 DVD into your PC and restart it. Press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS setup (usually F2, F10, F12 or Del) and change the boot order to make the DVD drive the first option. Save and exit the BIOS setup and wait for the Leo4Allv3 DVD to load. You should see a welcome screen with a language selection menu. Choose your preferred language and click Next.
 
## Step 3: Prepare Your Hard Drive
 
Before you can install Mac OS X Leopard on your PC, you need to format your hard drive with a Mac-compatible file system. To do this, click on Utilities in the menu bar and select Disk Utility. In Disk Utility, select your hard drive from the left panel and click on Erase. Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the format and give your hard drive a name. Click on Erase and confirm your choice. When the process is done, close Disk Utility and return to the installer.
 
## Step 4: Customize Your Installation
 
Now you are ready to install Mac OS X Leopard on your PC. Click on Continue and agree to the license agreement. Then, select your hard drive as the destination and click on Customize. Here you can choose which components you want to install or skip. The most important part is to select the right kernel and drivers for your hardware. Depending on your processor, you can choose between Vanilla (for Intel), Voodoo (for AMD) or ToH (for both) kernels. You can also select drivers for your graphics card, sound card, network card, etc. from the various categories. Be careful not to select incompatible or unnecessary drivers, as they may cause problems later. When you are done customizing your installation, click on Done and then Install.
 
## Step 5: Finish Your Installation
 
The installation process may take some time, depending on your hardware and the options you selected. When it is finished, you will be asked to restart your PC. Remove the Leo4Allv3 DVD from your drive and let your PC boot from your hard drive. You should see a welcome video followed by a setup assistant that will guide you through the initial configuration of Mac OS X Leopard. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Mac OS X Leopard on your Intel or AMD PC with Leo4Allv3.
